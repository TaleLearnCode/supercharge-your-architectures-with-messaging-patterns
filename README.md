## Abstract

Join this full-day, hands-on workshop to revolutionize your cloud architectures with powerful messaging patterns. Messaging paradigms like Publish-Subscribe, Message Queues, and Request-Reply aren’t just for microservices—they’re critical building blocks for creating resilient, scalable, and responsive systems. Focusing on Azure’s messaging capabilities with Service Bus as our primary tool, you’ll explore how these patterns streamline communication, optimize process flows, and enhance system reliability. Through interactive labs and real-world examples drawn from diverse environments, you’ll gain the practical skills and best practices to transform your architectural strategies and accelerate digital transformation.
